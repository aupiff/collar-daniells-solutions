Mars, the ancestor of the Romans, loved arms, battles & wars. Romulus and
Remus, sons of the god of arms, built Rome. And so, battles and wars delighted
the minds of the Romans. The Romans worshiped Mercury and Neptune and Vesta.
Mercury, messenger of the gods, told the inhabitants of the earth the commands
of the gods. Sailors worshiped Neptune, god of waters and the ocean. Women
worshipped Vesta, goddess of the hearth, and they prepared many gifts for this
goddess.
