De Icaro

Mārcus. Fābulam bonam amicus meus hodiē nārrāvit.
Iūlia. Dē quō nārrāvit amīcus tuus?
Mārcus. Dē Īcarō, Daedalī fīliō, puerō miserō.
Iūlia. Ubi habitābat Īcarus? In Britanniā?
Mārcus. Nōn in Britanniā habitābat, sed in Crētā, īnsulā magnā et clārā. Daedalus fīliō ālās finxit et parāvit. Eās ālās Icaro magnā cum cūrā cērā aptāvit. Ālae Īcarō grātae erant. Tum Daedalus puerum volāre (to fly) docuit, sed altius (too high) volāvit Īcarus. Itaque sōl (the sum) cēram solvit, et ālae dēcidērunt.
Iulia. Sed quid dē Īcarō?
Mārcus. Īcarus quoque decidit in ōceanum.
Iulia. Ēheu (alas), miserum Īcarum!

Marcus. Today my friend told me a good story.
Julia. What did your friend tell about?
Marcus. About Icarus, the son of Daedalus, a miserable boy.
Julia. Where was Icarus living? In Britain?
Marcus. No, he wasn't living in Britain, but on Crete, a large and famous island. Daedalus fashioned and prepared wings for his son. He fit these wings with wax to Icarus with great care. The wings were pleasing to Icarus. Then Daedalus taught his son to fly but Icarus flew too high. And then the son loosened the wax and the wings fell off.
Julia. But what about Icarus?
Marcus. Icarus also fell into the ocean.
Julia. Alas, wretched Icarus!

ROMANI PRO SOCIIS PUGNANT

Quod iniūriae multae fuērunt, sociī nostrī auxilium postulant. Itaque Romānī lēgātum cum virīs in terram Helvētiōrum mittent. Is lēgātus iam virōs convocāvit in oppidum. Cibum et carrōs ēmit et virōs gladiīs scūtīsque armāvit. Sociī interim frūmentum parāvērunt. Hodiē lēgātus animōs virōrum cōnfirmābit. Tum in agrōs finitimōs virōs dūcet et proelium exspectābit. Locus eius proelī propinquus Helvētiīs est. Nostrī virī magnō cum studiō prō sociīs pugnābunt et Helvētiōs superābunt. Multōs captivōs in oppidum ducent. Eī captīvī in vīcīs nostrīs hiemābunt.

Because there were many injuries, our allies are demanding help. And so the
Romans will send a lieutenant with men to the land of the Helvetians. This
lieutenant now called together men in the town. He bought food and carriagesand armed the men with swords and shields. The allies, meanwhile, prepared grain. Today the lieutenant will strengthen the souls of the men. Then he will lead the men to neighboring fields and will wait for battle. The location of this battle is close to the Helvetians. Our men will fight with great zeal for the allies and will overcome the Helvetians. The will lead many captives to the town. These captives will spend the winter in our villages.
